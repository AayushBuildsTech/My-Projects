<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    Hello! My name is Aayush and I'm thrilled to share a little bit about myself. I am a 14-year-old student at Delhi Public School Electronic City. My passion lies in coding, entrepreneurship, and building new technology that can make a difference in the world.

    When I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games or participating in sports like football and badminton. I believe that an active and healthy lifestyle is essential for success, both in and out of the classroom. I also enjoy exploring different topics and ideas through debate and am proud to be the debate master of my school.

    My love for technology and entrepreneurship has led me to learn programming languages like Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I enjoy using my knowledge and skills to create solutions that can make a positive impact on society. I am also well-versed in video production processes, including filming, editing, and post-production, which helps me create visually appealing content.

    In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen interest in digital marketing and understand the importance of reaching the right audience. I have experience in social media marketing, SEO, and SEM, and I'm always eager to learn more.

    As I continue to grow and develop my skills, I'm excited to see where my passion for technology and entrepreneurship takes me. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I look forward to connecting with you!
